## Ever wondered why certain websites or products captivate us? The answer often lies in <span>cognitive biases</span>

Cognitive bias are those mental shortcuts influencing our choices. For designers, comprehending these biases can be a game-changer.

## 1. Confirmation Bias

**People tend to favor information confirming their existing beliefs.**

**+** Designers can tap into this by aligning design and content with users' expectations.

**-** To avoid manipulation, designers should maintain transparency, ensuring content and design don't selectively present information confirming existing biases.

## 2. Anchoring Bias

**We often rely heavily on the first information we encounter.**

**+** For pricing, start with a higher option to make others seem more affordable. In different contexts, provide a clear starting point or instruction to guide choices.

**-** Ensure anchors are informative, not coercive, to prevent users from feeling forced into undesirable choices.

## 3. Choice Supportive Bias

**People retroactively ascribe positive attributes to their past choices.**

**+** After users make a choice, highlight the benefits of their chosen option, fostering a happier user.

**-** Don't neglect alternative options; provide clear information about different choices to enhance trust.

## 4. Availability Heuristic

**People rely on readily available information when making decisions.**

**+** Make crucial information easily available with clear and prominent design elements.

**-** To avoid overwhelming users, focus on providing digestible essential data.

## 5. Social Proof Bias

**People conform to the actions or opinions of others.**

**+** Incorporate social proof elements, like user reviews or endorsements, to positively influence users.

**-** Beware of inauthentic social proof elements that can damage trust and credibility.
