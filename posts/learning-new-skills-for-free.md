## What skills do you want to learn?

### The best thing to do before signing up to anything is deciding what you want to learn. Many platforms, no matter what they claim all have specialisms or courses that really stand out in different fields.

For me, I wanted to get some experience with Unity 2D and C#. After a few weeks of experimenting here are my top picks:

### Sololearn *(C#)*

[Sololearn has the world's largest collection of FREE programming courses](#) to learn how to code. Learn Python, C++, JavaScript, Java, jQuery, machine learning, data science, and more. You receive a certificate for each course that you complete.

While a bit frustrating to progress in a language you already know, [SoloLearn can be an awesome learning tool for the fundamentals](#).
