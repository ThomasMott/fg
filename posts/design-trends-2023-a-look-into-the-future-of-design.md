Design, like many other professions, is a constantly evolving field, and staying current with the latest trends and techniques is essential for any designer. As we are already nearing the first quarter of 2023, there have been many exciting changes.

## In this article, we will explore the emerging design trends that will shape the field throughout 2023 and the coming years.

From minimalist aesthetics to exciting new color palettes, we have a lot to look forward to!

### Minimalism Reimagined

It feels as though Minimalism has been a popular design trend for years, and it shows no signs of slowing down. However, as we continue to push the boundaries of style in 2023 we can expect to see bold new takes on this classic style. Rather than just stripping designs down to their bare essentials, designers will start to explore more innovative minimalist aesthetics. This had already begun to include the use of negative space in creative ways, or the incorporation of subtle geometric patterns. An extention of this is the rise of Neomorphism, a visual effect that utilises background colours, shadows, shapes, gradients, and highlights to achieve defined, yet minimal, graphic effects for user interface components.

### Bold Color Palettes

In recent years, muted tones and pastels have dominated the world of design. However, in 2023 we can expect to see a shift towards bolder, more vibrant color palettes. This trend is driven in part by the rise of mobile design, where striking colors are needed to grab user attention. Expect to see bright, eye-catching hues paired with unexpected combinations of complementary colors.

These colors will help to inject playfulness and fun with their vibrant and highly-saturated hues.

### Next-Level 3D Graphics

Technological advancements and AI-based content generators have made it easy to create and source much more sophisticated 3D graphics, and designers are eager to take advantage of this. In 2023, we can expect to see more intricate and detailed 3D models, in both web and product design. This will create a more immersive experience for users, and allow designers to push the envelope even further.

### Natural Elements

Amidst a world dominated by technology, there is a growing desire for designs that feel more organic and natural. This trend will continue to gain momentum in 2023, with designers incorporating more natural elements into their work. Expect to see an emphasis on organic shapes and textures, as well as the use of natural colors.

We are seeing some of this with the calm and cool color palettes that many major brands, like Burger King, are adopting as they continue to push on in the wave of retro nostalgia rebranding. In doing so they are hoping to draw us to the percieved safety of brands that remind us of a much less technologically dominated time.
