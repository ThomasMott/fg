## First Post

<br>

### Welcome to Fox Gibbon.

Fox Gibbon is place for tech, design and hobby enthusiasts.

I have created this website as a place to find up to date tutorials, news and discussions. The aim is truly to try and pull back the design and technology a little further for people who are new to design, professionals or just generally interested. I'm aiming to place a strong emphasis on good practice, accessibility and want to make these posts as easy to digest as possible.

One day I would also like to make this a place to celebrate brands that are independent, challenging the big brands with amazing new innovations. But for now I am just one man and a laptop.
