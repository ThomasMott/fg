title: Embrace the Amazing Gift of Limited Life
name: embrace-the-amazing-gift-of-limited-life
tldr: Life is an extraordinary gift, but it's also finite. Each of us has a limited number of hours to experience the world, create memories, and pursue our dreams. It's easy to lose sight of this fact in the hustle and bustle of daily life, but it's a truth that we should embrace and celebrate.

## How many hours

Imagine for a moment that you can see how many hours you have left in your life.

### If you are 30 years old, thats around 300,000 hours left

That might sound like a lot, but in the grand scheme of things, it's a precious and finite resource. Knowing that our time is limited can be a powerful motivator to make the most of every moment. It reminds us to cherish our relationships, explore the world, learn, grow, and follow our passions.

Every sunrise is a new opportunity, and every day is a chance to create something amazing. By recognizing the value of our limited time, we can make the most of every hour, living life to the fullest. Embrace your journey, treasure your moments, and savor the extraordinary gift of your limited life.

At the age I am now, if i'm lucky, I have:

<h1 id="life"></h1>

I hope I can use them well.

<script>
	// Date future
    var date_future = new Date("01/15/2058");

	// Update the count down every 1 second
	var x = setInterval(function() {
		// Get today's date and time
		var date_now = new Date();

		// get total seconds between the times
		var delta = Math.abs(date_future - date_now) / 1000;

		// calculate (and subtract) whole hours
		var hours = Math.floor(delta / 3600);
		delta -= hours * 3600;

		// calculate (and subtract) whole minutes
		var minutes = Math.floor(delta / 60) % 60;
		delta -= minutes * 60;

		// what's left is seconds
		var seconds = Math.round(delta % 60);

		//To display the final no. of days (result)
		console.log(`${hours}h ${minutes}m ${seconds}s`);

		// Display the result in the element with id="demo"
		document.getElementById("life").innerHTML = hours + "h "
		+ minutes + "m " + seconds + "s ";

		// If the count down is finished, write some text
		if (distance < 0) {
			clearInterval(x);
			document.getElementById("life").innerHTML = "EXPIRED";
		}
	}, 1000);
</script>
