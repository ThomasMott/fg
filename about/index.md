Hi, I am a Ux / UI designer with and MA in User Experience design and about 4 years working in startups and small businesses.

I created this blog to try and help navigate some of the biggest challenges I faced and hopefully nudge you, the reader in the right direction. The hope is that this will also become a place where I can add some odd things that you might not see on the slightly more starched mainstream. I would also like to make this a place to celebrate brands that are independent, challenging the big brands with amazing new innovations. But for now I am just one man and a laptop.

This blog is an emphasis on experimentation. My definition of a life well lived is to try my hand at as many things as I can, even if sometimes the result is a bit hard to look at.If you yourself have any images, posts, ideas or stories then [reach out](mailto:ThomasNMott1997@gmail.com)! This project is also [open source](https://github.com/ThomasMott/fg), so feel free to add anything you think would be interesting as a pr, I would love to see it.

If you like the sound of this then why not bookmark this website to keep up with the action. New posts on the 12th and 24th of each month.
