I have created this website as a place to find up to date tutorials, news and discussions. The aim is truly to try and pull back the design and technology a little further for people who are new to design, professionals or just generally interested. I'm aiming to place a strong emphasis on good practice, accessibility and want to make these posts as easy to digest as possible.

One day I would also like to make this a place to celebrate brands that are independent, challenging the big brands with amazing new innovations. But for now I am just one man and a laptop.

If you like the sound of this then why not bookmark this website or follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/FoxGibbon") to keep up with all the action. Aiming to create a new posts every 2 weeks.

If you read this far then thankyou for reading. Why not see some of the [Latest Posts](/).

If you want to contribute a post, I will be adding a readme with more information on the [Github](https://github.com/ThomasMott/fg) soon. 

Everything is open source, feel free to add anything you think would be interesting :)
