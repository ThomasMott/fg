		<h2>About me</h2>
		<p>I'm located in <strong>Bristol</strong>, England. I have worked as a freelance consultant in the past and am always interested in impactful opportunities. This can be from accessibility audits, to wireframing or coding front-end components.</p>
		<p>Depending on project needs, I can:</p>
		<ul class="list">
			<li>High-level accessibility audits to understand areas for improvement, focused on best-practices, WCAG compliance, and practical next steps</li>
			<li>User experience content writing</li>
			<li>Wireframing and interactive prototypes</li>
			<li>Creating design language and component libraries</li>
			<li>Developing new and implementing new components improvements and bugfixes <em>(or advise the team on the improvements)</em></li>
			<li>Conducting user testing and synthesizing data into actionable opportunities</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Previously, I have worked in-house in start-ups and small businesses, where I focused on designing and building intuitive front-ends. I have also worked as a graphic and product designer.</p>
		<p>My strength has always been in multidisciplinary roles. I excel at performing audits and reviews, engaging in user testing, writing design system libraries, and getting hands-on with front-end development. And in engineering projects I typically take on a double role as ux designer/front-end developer.</p>
